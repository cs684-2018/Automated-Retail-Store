### Project Description:
**Computer Vision** based partially-automated store where customers are able to purchase products without using a cashier or checkout station. 

The aim of the project is to *reduce computational cost* inherent in using Computer Vision on such a large scale. 

We present **Embedded Systems** based solution to replace the ‘checkout station’ for convenience of customer by saving time. We plan to use location tracking along with weighing mechanism to identify purchased products. 

Our project, once scaled, has potential to impact millions of people’s retail store experience.
